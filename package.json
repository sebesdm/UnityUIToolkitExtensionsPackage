This can be excluded on import.\n\n== Tables ==\nIn order for tables to be formatted correctly, a GameObject with the TableElementProcessor component must be added.  Sample data can be generated for a table by adding the SampleTableGenerator component to a GameObject in the scene.\n\n== Drag and Drop ==\nThe DraggableTargetElement is a modified version of the Unity UI Toolkit example on drag and drop found here https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UIE-create-drag-and-drop-ui.html.  I found that this example had some positioning issues when draggable elements were not positioned in the very top-left corner of their container.\n\nTo use, add DraggableTargetElements into your document hierarchy and use as though they were regular visual elements.  Add a class that will be used to restrict which draggables can go to which draggable targets.  Initialize your draggable with the DragAndDropManipulator from any MonoBehaviour.\n\nKnown Issues:\n- Tables do not display correctly when a document is hidden and displayed",
